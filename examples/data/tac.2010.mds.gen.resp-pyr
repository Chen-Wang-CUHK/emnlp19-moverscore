sharp metal edges of the wreck, turning the area into a coral graveyard, Cheng claimed.", "He added that after a series of observations, it has been found that in a 2 km by 500 meter coral reef area near Lungkeng, Kenting, coral coverage rate has continued to drop.", "Contrary to previous speculation that the freighter's wreckage could become an undersea artificial fishery reef, he said, the ship has disintegrated in the strong currents and its debris has continued to spread, posing increasing threats to the coral.", "The harmful debris will not disappear by itself and it cannot be \"digested\" by the sea, Cheng argued, adding that the only option is to have it removed before more coral, the ecological system and Taiwan's tourism resources are further compromised.", "A similar situation has been found in an undersea area to the east of Green Island, where the freighter Picasso sank 12 years ago, Cheng said.", "By comparison, he said, coral reefs near Penghu Island are found
